Observations: Bar |
Of those that go to the bar at least once a month, it seems there are somethings in common between those who are more likely to use coupons.
It seems that those who do not bring their children (regardless if they have them or not) are more likely to use coupons. 
There seems to be a positive correlation between those who frequent the bar more often and those who use bar coupons.
Those who were in the age group of 25 - 30 seemed to be more likely to use coupons. 

Observations: Cheap Restaurants (<$20) |
There seems to be a slight negative correlation between those who use coupons at cheap restaurants in regards to their income. Higher income seems to lower the likelihood of using coupons at cheap restaurants. 
It seems that males that go at least once a month to cheap restaurants use coupons slightly more than females do.
